why:
- One Ruby - Powerful object oriented programming language
- Ruby - Powerful object oriented programming language
- Built in support for basic security features (Preventing XSS, CSRF, SQL Injections)
- Suitable for developing production ready applications.
- Wider community
- Test driven
- MVC framework
- Tons of plugins and libraries
- Using by big companies (Basecamp, Github, Shopify, Airbnb, Twitch, Zendesk)
- Suitable for Faster & Rapid application development
- Built in support for running asynchronous jobs, Payment integrations, task runner,
  DB migrations
whyMallow:
- We have more than 7 years of experience in Ruby on Rails development and we developed
  many high traffic web applications in Ruby on Rails.
- We use high standard developing tools in our environment. For example, we use Rubymine
  as our development IDE.
- We use many performance oriented tools in development to make sure it is ready and
  safer for production. For example, we use strong_migration gem to make sure every
  DB migration is safer for large volume databases.
- We use New relic tool in development as well to monitor the application performance.
  For example, we monitor page speed, query performance, hardware utilisation, etc.
  So that, moving to production is simple and safe.
- We setup asset pipeline for production applications, so that the javascript and
  CSS files are minified and ready for caching in live. We also setup CDN in live
  like AWS cloud front or Cloud flare for serving assets from the near by region of
  the user.
- We are using Rspec library to test the application features automatically. Doing
  changes in large scale applications will be easier since we follow Test driven approach.
- We are capable of developing very complex applications in Ruby on Rails. For example,
  we have developed few real time applications which receive and process high volume
  of data per second.
- We monitor our production Rails applications regularly and if required we setup
  PagerDuty to notify in case of any issues in live.
